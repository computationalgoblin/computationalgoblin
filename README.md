## Hi there!

### Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Angel, a Junior Data Analyst with a background in Psychology and a **BIG** passion for data science. I recently graduated from Ironhack’s Data Analytics Master program. I thrive on tackling learning challenges both autonomously and as part of a team. My mission is to enhance and simplify lives—both within companies and for individuals—through the power of data.

On my main page, you'll find a collection of the projects I'm currently working on, as well as those I've completed. Each project includes a corresponding README file where you can read more about it in detail.

Right now, I am eager to apply my skills in real-world settings. I'm actively looking for job opportunities in the data field. If you find something interesting in my portfolio, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) or via email at [angelexpgar@gmail.com](mailto:angelexpgar@gmail.com).

### Current Projects
At the moment, I'm continuing the projects I started during my last training and incorporating every new tool I learn. I am currently studying for the Microsoft PL-300 and AZ-900 certifications and applying the tools and knowledge gained from these courses. I expect to start new projects soon, and I will keep this README updated with any new changes!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
